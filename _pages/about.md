I am an Interdisciplinary Researcher at the Interface of Machine Learning and Material Science.
During my PhD I worked on the application of coordinate free models to triage computational materials discovery.
This work culminated in the development of the `roost` and `wren` frameworks. 
Since graduating I worked briefly on deployment of machine learning models on public cloud infrastructure before realising that I wanted to work directly on problems not platforms.
This realisation led me to join Chemix where I am now sitting in the software team developing models and tools for self-driving battery R&D (<a href="https://apply.workable.com/chemix/">We're hiring!</a>).
