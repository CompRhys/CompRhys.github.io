I am an Interdisciplinary Researcher at the Interface of Machine Learning and Material Science.
During my PhD I worked on the application of coordinate free models to triage computational materials discovery.
This work culminated in the development of the `roost` and `wren` frameworks. 
In industry I have worked on tools for running quantum mechanics software and machine learning models on public cloud infrastructure as well as the development of assorted models and design of experiments tools for battery R&D.
